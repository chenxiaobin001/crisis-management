access control



1. ApplicationController
applicationController has two helper_methods,  ‘current_user’ and ‘is_admin?’  and has one method ‘check_privileges!’.  ‘current_user’  is to get the signed-in user information, ‘is_admin?’ is to check if current user is admin, and ‘check_privileges!’ is to protect some urls from being accessed by non-admin users. The reason of having these three methods in applicationController is that in all views and other controllers, the functionalities of getting current user, verifying current user and protecting sensitive data are always needed.

2.AuthenticationController
AuthenticationController has three actions: ‘sign_in’, ‘signed_out’, ‘login’ which functionalities are obvious.

3.DocumentsController
DocumentsController has the methods generated by scaffold command, with some modification.  For example in method ‘index’, before rendering the view ‘index’, the method first check if current_user exists, if not, redirect_to root_url, if yes then further check if current user is admin, then retrieve documents according to current user’s privilege and association with documents and render view.
Besides, a before_action is used with method ‘check_privileges!’ for [:new, :create, :destroy], because currently  we only admin to create documents, destroy documents. 
Further user’s privilege check(such as  will be implementd in the next iteration when we start to implement documents editting functionality.

4.GroupDocsController
GroupDocsController has the methods generated by scaffold command, more mothods will be implemented in the next iteration.
